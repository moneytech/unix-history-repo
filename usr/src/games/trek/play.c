**  INSTRUCTION READ AND MAIN PLAY LOOP
**
**	Well folks, this is it.  Here we have the guts of the game.
**	This routine executes moves.  It sets up per-move variables,
**	gets the command, and executes the command.  After the command,
**	it calls events() to use up time, attack() to have Klingons
**	attack if the move was not free, and checkcond() to check up
**	on how we are doing after the move.
